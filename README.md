# web_crawler
 Python web crawler of internal domain links.
 
 This application crawls a single domain to scrape all of its internal URLs.
 It starts from the domain main page and goes through each sub page or internal
 URL to keep scraping for more links.
 
 When scraping is done it prints the links from each page on the domain to every
 other page on the same domain as a list of links in the format A => B
